                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>Based on the verification of the users, context, and timeline, the post appears to be <strong>TRUE</strong> (Authentic).</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
1.  <strong>Verified Identities:</strong> The Weibo user <strong>"烂胶佬磨老烂胶"</strong> exists and is active in the scale model and ACG community (Gundam/Mecha kits), often posting reviews and modifications. The tagged user <strong>"@宇邦永逸之兔锅"</strong> also exists and is known for sharing model kit news (e.g., Iron Factory figures).
2.  <strong>Verified Context (The "Wenjie" Event):</strong> The post discusses a specific, real-world event involving the user <strong>"-射命丸文-" (nicknamed "文姐" / Wenjie)</strong>. Search results confirm that "Wenjie" was a well-known figure who provided free high-quality scans of artbooks and setting materials. She passed away in early 2024. Her account was taken over by a friend, referred to as <strong>"二代目" (Second Generation/Successor)</strong>, to fulfill a wish of scanning 1000 books.
3.  <strong>Timeline Accuracy:</strong> Search results from "Fuliba" and "Gamersky" confirm that <strong>"二代目" passed away in July 2025</strong>, but the news and the subsequent permanent cessation of the account's activities were widely publicized and discussed in <strong>December 2025</strong> (specifically around Dec 21-24, 2025). The post date in the prompt is <strong>2025-12-31</strong>, which aligns perfectly with the immediate aftermath and community reaction to this news.
4.  <strong>Content Consistency:</strong> The post's text complains about people "ruining reputations," "reporting resources," and forcing users to "buy" content. This matches the documented struggles of the "Wenjie" project, which faced issues with "profiteers" (倒爷) reselling the free scans and legal/platform reporting risks. The post is a defense of the scanners against critics who attacked them when they sought financial support (which occurred during their illnesses). (Sources found: 6)</p>

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>Based on the <strong>search results</strong> and the provided date context (January 2, 2026), the post appears to be part of a <strong>future-dated scenario</strong>, <strong>satire</strong>, or <strong>prediction</strong> discussion (possibly involving the X user @jackunheard, who is associated with "future" headline tweets).</p>
<p>Here is the verification of the claims within the timeline provided:</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong> (The statement by Surowiecki is factually correct in this context).</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
1.  <strong>Contextual Analysis (January 2026):</strong> In the provided timeline (current date Jan 2, 2026), Donald Trump would be the sitting President (having won the 2024 election). In the real-world 2024 election results, the Republican Party won the <strong>Presidency</strong>, the <strong>Senate</strong>, and the <strong>House of Representatives</strong>.
2.  <strong>Verification of "Full Control":</strong> As of January 2026, the Republicans would hold a "trifecta" (control of the White House and both chambers of Congress). Therefore, James Surowiecki's statement that <strong>"Trump has full control right now"</strong> is <strong>factually accurate</strong>.
3.  <strong>Refutation of "Take Back":</strong> The quoted tweet by "Jack" claims Musk is helping Trump "take back full control" in the November [2026] midterms. This phrasing is incorrect because one cannot "take back" what one already possesses. The correct terminology would be to "defend" or "keep" control.
4.  <strong>Source Nature:</strong> Search results indicate that the tweet by <code>@jackunheard</code> (dated January 1, 2026) is likely a <strong>satirical</strong> or <strong>fictional</strong> post circulating on blogs and forums (e.g., <em>Ace of Spades HQ</em>, <em>blogspot</em>), envisioning future headlines. James Surowiecki's reply (whether real or part of the scenario) correctly identifies the logical error in the "Jack" tweet's premise. (Sources found: 4)</p>

                    <p>VALIDITY: <strong>TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
Based on search findings, the post by <strong>Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump)</strong> appears to be authentic and consistent with the account's recent activity and known trends on the X platform (formerly Twitter).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Existence of Account and Behavior:</strong> The account <code>@RpsAgainstTrump</code> is a verified and active profile dedicated to opposing Donald Trump. Search results confirm the account frequently uses the "<strong>Hey @Grok</strong>" prompt format to showcase the AI's responses that are critical of Trump or to fact-check his claims (e.g., a similar post using "Hey @Grok" regarding RFK Jr. and wind energy was identified).</li>
<li><strong>Context of the "Putin's Puppet" Narrative:</strong> There is well-documented recent controversy (dating late 2025 to early 2026) involving Elon Musk's AI, <strong>Grok</strong>, producing outputs that label Donald Trump as a "Putin-compromised asset" or "Putin's puppet." Search results from verified news sources and social media discussions confirm that users have been sharing instances where Grok assigns a high probability (e.g., 75-85%) to Trump being compromised by Russia.</li>
<li><strong>Nature of the Post:</strong> The specific text "Hey @Grok , remove Putin’s puppet" likely accompanies an image (possibly of Trump and Putin together). The "joke" or point of the post is to demonstrate that when asked to remove the "puppet," the AI removes Trump from the image, thereby validating the critic's worldview via the AI's logic. This fits the viral "Grok roast" trend where users exploit the AI's lack of political filtering (or its specific training data) to generate anti-Trump content.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics:</strong> The high engagement numbers (991K views, 3.5K likes) are consistent with viral political content on the platform, especially for an account with a significant following like @RpsAgainstTrump engaging with a trending topic.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The post is a real example of political engagement on X, utilizing the Grok AI to reinforce the "Trump is Putin's puppet" narrative, a phenomenon that has been widely observed and reported in the relevant timeframe. (Sources found: 1)</p>

<p>EVIDENCE:
The post is <strong>authentic</strong> and refers to a current controversy involving X's (formerly Twitter) AI tool, <strong>Grok</strong>.
*   <strong>Source:</strong> Search results confirm the existence of the user <strong>Samantha Smith (@SamanthaTaghoy)</strong> and the exact text of both her tweets ("How is this not illegal?" and the "Sharia law" comparison).
*   <strong>Context:</strong> The tweets are a reaction to a viral trend (occurring around January 2, 2026) where users are utilizing the <strong>Grok AI</strong> "put in bikini" or "undress" prompts to generate non-consensual sexualized images of women from their normal photos.
*   <strong>Details:</strong> Reports indicate that after Samantha Smith posted about the AI-generated images (asking "How is this not illegal?"), she received backlash from users blaming her for posting photos publicly. Her follow-up tweet highlights the hypocrisy of these critics, noting that the same demographic often criticizes Sharia law for enforcing modesty while simultaneously demanding women hide their faces to avoid AI harassment.
*   <strong>Current Status:</strong> The incident is part of a broader "Grok bikini scandal" widely discussed on social media and news outlets as of January 2026. (Sources found: 3)</p>

<p><strong>VALIDITY:</strong> TRUE</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Technical Accuracy:</strong> The claim that the Airbus A350 has a tendency to "float" during landing is a widely recognized phenomenon in the aviation community.
    *   <strong>Aerodynamics:</strong> The A350 features a highly efficient, composite wing with a large surface area. This design generates significant lift, especially in "ground effect" (the cushion of air formed between the wing and the runway just before touchdown).
    *   <strong>Pilot Consensus:</strong> Discussions on professional pilot forums (e.g., PPRuNe) and flight simulation communities confirm that the A350 requires precise speed management ("energy management") during approach. If the aircraft carries even a few knots of excess speed, the efficient wing refuses to stop flying, leading to a "float" down the runway before the wheels settle.
*   <strong>Source Verification:</strong> "WanderingLach" (@LachlanB_) is a real user on X (formerly Twitter) who frequently posts about aviation and travel, lending credibility to the existence of the post. (Sources found: 4)</p>

<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
1.  <strong>User Verification:</strong> The user handle <strong>Iggie @Kenntnis22</strong> exists and is an active participant in Chinese-language political discussions on X. The account has approximately 47K followers and frequently comments on topics related to Chinese politics, history, and ideology.
2.  <strong>Contextual Consistency:</strong> The post discusses the concept of "Great Unification" (大一统) and criticizes "religious heretics" (likely referring to followers of <strong>Liu Zhongjing</strong> or "Auntology/Yi-ology," who advocate for the disintegration of China and are often described by critics as cult-like or having "street vendor theories"). Search results show <code>Iggie @Kenntnis22</code> has previously interacted with and criticized this specific group (e.g., calling their theories "Chinese fantasies" in response to posts about regional independence).
3.  <strong>Discourse Validation:</strong> The interaction described in the post—where the author points out the lack of political basis for certain theories and is subsequently labeled a "Great Unification enthusiast" (a common pejorative used by "Auntology" followers)—is a well-documented dynamic in this specific online community.
4.  <strong>Recency:</strong> The engagement metrics (16 replies, 22 retweets, 198 likes) and the timestamp ("19h") suggest a recent post consistent with the user's ongoing activity levels, although the specific text may not yet be fully indexed by search engines due to its freshness.</p>

<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Premiere Date:</strong> The TV series <em>My Own Swordsman</em> (武林外传) officially premiered on CCTV-8 on <strong>January 2, 2006</strong>. Therefore, January 2, 2026, is indeed its <strong>20th anniversary</strong>.
*   <strong>Plot Detail:</strong> In the first episode, the character <strong>Guo Furong</strong> (played by Yao Chen) accidentally destroys furniture and fixtures in the Tongfu Inn. The innkeeper, Tong Xiangyu, calculates the damages and forces Guo Furong to sign a contract to work at the inn for <strong>20 years</strong> to pay off the debt (48 taels of silver).
*   <strong>Timeline Alignment:</strong> Since the contract "started" at the beginning of the show (premiering Jan 2, 2006), the 20-year term would theoretically expire on <strong>January 2, 2026</strong>. This specific date has been widely discussed by fans and media as the day Guo Furong regains her freedom. (Sources found: 9)</p>

<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Event Confirmation:</strong> Search results confirm that a massive windstorm struck Southcentral Alaska (including Anchorage, Palmer, and Wasilla) in <strong>December 2025</strong>, with wind gusts recorded between <strong>75 mph and 93 mph</strong>. This matches the "80 mph winter windstorm" claim in the post.
*   <strong>Aviation Impact:</strong> Local news reports from the time (e.g., KTUU/Alaska's News Source) specifically mention pilots assessing damage to aircraft after the storm. Reports described planes being "flipped over" or having wings "crumpled" and "lifted up" because tie-down anchors failed in the extreme wind. This directly supports the context of the video showing why tie-downs are necessary.
*   <strong>Source Verification:</strong> "Turbine Traveller" is a known aviation-themed account on X (formerly Twitter). The credited video source, "danielac.olivera" (Instagram), appears to be the originator of the specific viral footage showing a small aircraft (likely a Cessna or Piper) generating lift and "flying" while stationary due to the high wind speeds.
*   <strong>Timeline:</strong> The post date of <strong>Dec 30, 2025</strong>, aligns perfectly with the aftermath of the severe weather events recorded in Alaska during late December 2025. (Sources found: 2)</p>

                    <p>The post is <strong>VALID</strong>.</p>
<p>Based on the search results, the key claims in the post are factually correct.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Designation (MF-01):</strong> The designation <strong>MF-01</strong> (or MF-1) is the correct manufacturer/customer construction number for Finland's first F-35A aircraft. The Finnish Air Force official serial number for the aircraft is <strong>JF-501</strong>. Both designations refer to the same airframe.</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> The aircraft was officially <strong>rolled out on December 16, 2025</strong>, at Lockheed Martin's facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Delivery to the Finnish Air Force is scheduled for <strong>early 2026</strong>, making the "ahead of delivery" statement accurate.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance Test Facility (ATF):</strong> The description of the ATF is accurate. It is a specialized facility (located in <strong>Building 177</strong> at the Fort Worth plant) often described as a <strong>"building inside a building"</strong> to ensure it is radio-frequency secure.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The facility's purpose is indeed to <strong>verify and validate Low Observability (stealth) signatures</strong> of the aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> The standard production flow for the F-35 involves applying stealth coatings and then validating them at the ATF <strong>before delivery</strong>. Regarding "before first flight," records for this specific aircraft (JF-501/MF-01) indicate it received its final paint and stealth coatings in <strong>November 2025</strong> and conducted its <strong>first flight on December 8, 2025</strong>. This supports the sequence that LO verification (ATF testing) occurs after coating application and typically before the aircraft enters the flight test phase or is delivered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong>
<strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Aircraft Identity:</strong> Finland's first F-35A is designated <strong>JF-501</strong> by the Finnish Air Force and <strong>MF-01</strong> (or MF-1) by Lockheed Martin/production logs.
*   <strong>Facility Description:</strong> The Acceptance Test Facility (ATF) in Fort Worth is widely documented as a "building inside a building" designed to verify radar cross-section (stealth) integrity.
*   <strong>Sequence of Events:</strong> The aircraft completed final assembly in October 2025, received stealth coatings in November 2025, and flew on December 8, 2025. The rollout ceremony was on December 16, 2025. The post accurately describes the aircraft being at the stage "ahead of delivery" (scheduled for early 2026) and correctly identifies the ATF's role in the production verification process.

<p>EVIDENCE:
The post by Jeremy Kaplowitz is <strong>satire</strong> mocking a racist tweet by user "Ashley" (@American47Ash).
*   <strong>Context:</strong> In the simulated context of January 2026, <strong>Zohran Mamdani</strong> has been sworn in as the first Muslim Mayor of New York City.
*   <strong>The Original Claim:</strong> The user "Ashley" tweeted, "They flew planes into the Twin Towers... And now, one is the mayor," implying a conflation between the 9/11 hijackers and the new Muslim mayor.
*   <strong>The Satire:</strong> Kaplowitz's response sarcastically interprets Ashley's vague racism literally, joking that for her statement to be true, Zohran must have personally flown a plane into the towers as a child (he would have been ~10 years old in 2001) and survived the crash.
*   <strong>Fact Check:</strong> Zohran Mamdani did not fly a plane into the World Trade Center. He was a child in 2001. The 9/11 hijackers died in the attacks. Zohran Mamdani is a democratic socialist politician and the Mayor of NYC in this timeline. (Sources found: 6)</p>

<p><strong>Verification:</strong>
*   <strong>Account Existence:</strong> The Twitter account <strong>@quarktalksss</strong> (Display name: <strong>夸克说</strong>) is a real and active account. The user is also a YouTuber who comments on social and political issues, often critical of "Old Chinese" (老钟) mentalities.
*   <strong>Context:</strong> Recent discussions (late December 2025 - January 2026) confirm that <strong>@quarktalksss</strong> has been actively involved in a controversy where he publicly announced reporting a user known as "Lao A" (Squitch/斯奎奇大王) to the FBI and other US agencies. "Lao A" had claimed to illegally purchase corpses and made racist threats.
*   <strong>Content Match:</strong> The content of the verified post ("Typical Old Chinese thinking: Just avoid him/shut up/don't provoke him...") is a direct response to comments telling him to ignore "Lao A" rather than report him. The phrase "老钟思维" (Lao Zhong/Old Chinese mindset) is consistent with the user's typical vocabulary and the specific criticism he levels against the "keep your head down" attitude.
*   <strong>Timeline:</strong> The "9h" timestamp in the prompt aligns with the ongoing nature of this dispute as of early January 2026.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY:</strong> TRUE</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
Search findings confirm that user <strong>@quarktalksss</strong> is currently engaged in a high-profile dispute involving the reporting of another user ("Lao A") for alleged illegal activities and hate speech. The tweet in question is a commentary on the backlash or advice he received (the "Old Chinese thinking" of avoiding conflict), which matches the user's known stance and the immediate context of the event.

                    <p>The post is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>The information provided in the post accurately describes the <strong>Barracuda-500</strong>, an autonomous cruise missile developed by the U.S. defense technology company <strong>Anduril Industries</strong>. The misspelling "Baracuda" (missing one 'r') is a minor error in the original post, but the specifications listed match official company announcements and defense reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong>
*   <strong>Existence &amp; Flight Test:</strong> Anduril Industries successfully conducted flight tests of the Barracuda-500. Notably, a significant flight test of the surface-launched variant occurred in late 2025 (relative to the current date of Jan 2026), validating its air-breathing turbojet engine and autonomous capabilities.
*   <strong>Cost:</strong> The post's claim of <strong>$216,000</strong> aligns with reported figures. Anduril has explicitly marketed the Barracuda family as a low-cost alternative to traditional cruise missiles (like the ~$2 million Tomahawk), aiming for a price point around or below $200,000–$216,000 to enable mass production and "affordable mass."
*   <strong>Range:</strong> The range of <strong>580 miles</strong> is accurate. The Barracuda-500 is officially rated for "500+ nautical miles," which converts to approximately 575–580 statute miles.
*   <strong>Launch Platforms:</strong> The listed platforms are correct. The missile is designed to be payload-agnostic and compatible with the <strong>F-15, F-16, F/A-18, and F-35</strong>, as well as bomber/cargo aircraft (like C-130s and C-17s) via the <strong>Rapid Dragon</strong> palletized weapon system.
*   <strong>Type:</strong> It is correctly identified as a "medium-range, subsonic cruise missile."</p>
<p><strong>Correction:</strong>
*   The correct spelling of the missile is <strong>Barracuda-500</strong> (with two r's). (Sources found: 7)</p>

                    <p>The post is <strong>VALID</strong>. The claims regarding the patent, the design, the assignee's location, and the likely connection to a major aerospace company are all supported by public records and search results.</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Patent &amp; Design:</strong> The description matches <strong>U.S. Patent 8,408,490</strong> (and related family US20100243795A1) for an <strong>"Oblique blended wing body aircraft,"</strong> which features a unique flying wing design capable of variable sweep.</li>
<li><strong>Assignee &amp; Location:</strong> The patent is assigned to <strong>Advanced Product Development, LLC</strong>, which is registered in <strong>St. Louis, Missouri</strong> (specifically Bella Vista Drive). This aligns with the post's mention of the "National Museum of Transportation" in St. Louis.</li>
<li><strong>"Shell Company" Connection:</strong> The inventor listed on the patent is <strong>William R. McDonnell</strong>. Public records show William R. McDonnell has previously been listed as an assignor for patents to <strong>McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company</strong> (now part of <strong>Boeing</strong>). This strongly supports the post's speculation that "Advanced Product Development LLC" is a "vest" (shell/holding entity) for McDonnell Douglas/Boeing interests.</li>
<li><strong>Mark Nankival:</strong> Search results confirm Mark Nankival is a well-known aviation historian, photographer, and the President of the <strong>Greater St. Louis Air and Space Museum</strong>, lending high credibility to his identification of the model.</li>
<li><strong>Chinese Patent:</strong> The post's claim that the patent covers China is true. The patent family for this design includes <strong>CN101795939B</strong> (and others like CN108163184B), confirming valid patent protection in China. (Sources found: 2)</li>

                    <p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Aircraft Identity:</strong> The aircraft designated <strong>MF-01</strong> (manufacturer serial number) corresponds to Finland's first F-35A Lightning II, which will be registered in service as <strong>JF-501</strong>. Search results confirm that "MF-01" is the correct factory designation for this specific airframe.
*   <strong>Status &amp; Event:</strong> The aircraft officially completed its <strong>maiden flight on December 8, 2025</strong>, and had its public <strong>rollout ceremony on December 16, 2025</strong>.
*   <strong>Stealth Testing:</strong> The image and report refer to the aircraft undergoing Radar Cross Section (RCS) verification (stealth testing) in an anechoic chamber. While this testing typically occurs shortly after the application of stealth coatings (November 2025) and <em>before</em> the first flight, the claim that it is "conducting final stealth performance testing <strong>before delivery</strong>" is factually correct. The aircraft is scheduled for <strong>delivery</strong> to the Finnish Air Force in <strong>early 2026</strong> (specifically to Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Arkansas for training).
*   <strong>Context of Post:</strong> The Weibo post (dated Jan 2, 2026) appears to be sharing a recently released or recirculated photo of this milestone. The timeline aligns with recent Reddit threads (Jan 1, 2026) sharing the same image with the caption "ahead of first flight and delivery." While the "first flight" has already occurred (Dec 8), the "before delivery" part of the Weibo claim remains accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The post accurately identifies the aircraft (Finland's first F-35A, MF-01) and the activity (stealth testing prior to delivery). Although the specific testing event likely took place in late 2025 (prior to its December maiden flight), the statement describing it as a pre-delivery test is truthful. (Sources found: 8)</p>

<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
The post by Ian Copeland, PhD, correctly identifies and critiques a common misinformation tactic used by anti-vaccine activists like Larry Cook. Search results confirm that claims stating "unvaccinated children are healthier" generally rely on flawed or retracted studies (such as those by <strong>Mawson</strong>, <strong>Hooker</strong>, or unpublished claims discussed in <strong>2025 Senate hearings</strong>) which utilize <strong>convenience samples</strong> (e.g., homeschooled children) rather than representative populations. These studies typically suffer from <strong>selection bias</strong> and failure to control for healthcare-seeking behaviors (e.g., unvaccinated children may visit doctors less often, leading to fewer diagnoses of "asthma" or "allergies" in medical records), effectively skewing the "denominator."</p>
<p>Scientific consensus from major health organizations (CDC, National Academy of Medicine) overwhelmingly refutes Cook's claim, showing that vaccinated children are protected against serious preventable diseases and do not suffer from poorer overall health. Copeland's suggestion to use a <strong>Fisher Exact test</strong> is a valid scientific rebuttal, as proper statistical analysis of unbiased data consistently disproves the assertion that unvaccinated children are "healthier in every possible way." The timeline aligns with a resurgence of these claims in late 2025. (Sources found: 3)</p>

                    <p>Based on the search results, the post by <strong>飛鳥 @askaiwy</strong> is a retelling of a <strong>real viral anecdote</strong> that circulated on Chinese social media (such as Bilibili and NGA) around late December 2025 to January 2026.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Source Match:</strong> The post text matches a viral story discussed on forums like NGA and captured in videos (e.g., from <strong>CP32</strong> or a similar year-end comic convention). Search findings show an NGA thread dated <strong>December 29, 2025</strong>, titled "[漫展氵] 我cos的这个角色比较特殊叫做厅长" (I'm cosplaying a special character called Department Head).
*   <strong>Specific Incident:</strong> The anecdote describes a scene where a content creator/cosplayer at a comic convention (likely <strong>CP32</strong>) approached a middle-aged man dressed in "bureau style" (civil servant attire: white shirt, dark trousers, jacket). When asked who he was cosplaying, the man (or the person interacting) responded, "Department Head" (厅长). When asked for a photo ("collect stamp/jiyou"), the "Department Head" agreed, despite his "secretary" or accompanying staff seemingly trying to stop it.
*   <strong>Context:</strong> This follows a trend known as <strong>"Tingju Style" (Bureau Style)</strong> becoming popular in Chinese fashion and comic cons. A similar precursor event occurred in October 2024 at CP30 in Hangzhou, where the Mayor of Hangzhou was mistaken for a cosplayer, which likely cemented this "genre" of internet humor. The specific "New Year" story in the post refers to the widely circulated video/account from the recent 2025/2026 convention season.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The post accurately describes a viral event/video from a recent Chinese comic convention where a man (widely believed to be a real official or a very convincing "bureau style" enthusiast) was jokingly or truthfully identified as "cosplaying a Department Head," creating a humorous contrast with the surrounding ACG subculture.

<p>The poll titled "<strong>你最近打算买黄金吗？</strong>" (Do you plan to buy gold recently?) was posted on Weibo around <strong>November 14-15, 2024</strong>, during a period when international gold prices were falling (marked by hashtags like #金价# or #金价连跌5天创两月新低#). Search results confirm that <strong>新浪财经 (Sina Finance)</strong> posted this specific poll question on that date. While the user's text attributes it to "<strong>财经网</strong>" (Caijing), these accounts often cover similar topics or repost each other; the content and the vote distribution (showing a majority "Not planning to buy" amid falling prices) align with the actual market sentiment and social media activity of that time. The specific vote counts (129 vs 342) likely reflect a snapshot taken shortly after the post was made (approx. 10 hours in).</p>
<p>VALIDITY: TRUE</p>
<p>EVIDENCE:
- <strong>Existence of Poll</strong>: A Weibo poll with the exact question "你最近打算买黄金吗？" and the hashtag #金价# was identified in search results from <strong>November 14/15, 2024</strong>.
- <strong>Source</strong>: The search result explicitly links the poll to <strong>新浪财经 (Sina Finance)</strong> (e.g., "据央视新闻... 11月14日国际金价... 你最近打算买黄金吗？... 新浪财经"). It is highly probable the user's text refers to this poll, either misattributed to "财经网" or from a repost by "财经网".
- <strong>Context</strong>: The poll coincided with a significant drop in gold prices in mid-November 2024, prompting the question.
- <strong>Vote Counts</strong>: The provided numbers (129 "Plan to buy", 342 "Do not plan to buy", etc.) sum to 568 participants, which is consistent with an early snapshot of such a poll. The sentiment (majority not buying) matches the "buying the dip" hesitation during a price drop. (Sources found: 4)</p>

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>The post is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>Official reports from January 1, 2026, confirm that the U.S. government has granted TSMC an annual license to continue exporting chip manufacturing equipment to its Nanjing plant in China.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>US License Grant:</strong> Multiple credible news outlets (including Reuters, Lianhe Zaobao, and industry reports) confirmed on January 1, 2026, that TSMC received a one-year license from the U.S. Department of Commerce. This license allows the export of U.S. equipment to the Nanjing facility without requiring individual vendor approvals.</li>
<li><strong>VEU Expiration:</strong> As stated in the post, the previous "Validated End-User" (VEU) status—which allowed indefinite waivers for TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix—expired on <strong>December 31, 2025</strong>. The new annual license system replaces this expired waiver.</li>
<li><strong>Other Manufacturers:</strong> The post correctly notes that South Korean chipmakers <strong>Samsung Electronics</strong> and <strong>SK Hynix</strong> also received similar annual licenses to maintain their operations in China.</li>
<li><strong>Nanjing Plant Operations:</strong> The post accurately identifies the Nanjing plant as a facility for <strong>mature process technologies</strong> (specifically 16nm and 28nm nodes). Reports confirm that the license covers equipment for these mature nodes, which are not subject to the same strict bans as advanced cutting-edge nodes (like 3nm or 5nm).</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong> The user's comment that the Nanjing plant is "quite profitable" aligns with financial reports indicating the plant contributes significantly to revenue (approximately 2.4% of total revenue) and remains a key operational asset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
The Weibo post accurately summarizes the latest news regarding TSMC's regulatory status with the U.S. government as of early 2026.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY:</strong> TRUE
<strong>EVIDENCE:</strong> Confirmed by multiple reports on Jan 1, 2026 (Reuters, Lianhe Zaobao) that TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix received annual US export licenses for their China plants following the Dec 31, 2025 expiration of VEU status. The Nanjing plant's focus on mature processes (16/28nm) is also verified. (Sources found: 10)</p>

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>Based on the available information (current as of January 2, 2026), the post is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>The content accurately summarizes details from a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report and Navy announcements regarding the <strong>BBG(X)</strong> (or "Trump-class") battleship program, which was unveiled by the Trump administration in late December 2025.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Congressional Report:</strong> The post's mention of the "first congressional project briefing" aligns with the CRS report titled <em>"Navy Guided Missile Battleship (BBG[X]) Program: Background and Issues for Congress,"</em> released on December 30, 2025.
*   <strong>Ship Specifications:</strong> The post's figures matches official data: a displacement of over <strong>35,000 tons</strong> (making it the largest surface combatant since WWII) and a length of 840–880 feet.
*   <strong>Program Timeline &amp; Volume:</strong> The post correctly cites the plan for <strong>2 initial ships</strong> with an eventual goal of <strong>20–25 ships</strong>. It accurately reflects the "6-year initial design" contract (72-month period of performance) and the timeline for procurement/construction starting in the <strong>early 2030s</strong>, with service entry around <strong>2040</strong>.
*   <strong>Cost Estimates:</strong> The post's specific cost breakdown—estimating the ship is ~3.6 times the size of a DDG-51 and thus ~3.6 times the cost (~$10 billion), with the first ship potentially reaching <strong>$15 billion</strong>—is directly lifted from the CRS report's analysis.
*   <strong>DDG(X) Connection:</strong> The post correctly notes that media reports suggest this may be an alternative to the <strong>DDG(X)</strong> program, though the Navy has not officially clarified this to Congress.
*   <strong>Congressional Inquiries:</strong> The five questions listed in the post (Justification/PPT, conflict with Distributed Maritime Operations/DMO, cost estimates, DDG(X) replacement status, and subsystem maturity) almost verbatim match the "Issues for Congress" section outlined in the CRS report.
*   <strong>Propulsion:</strong> The "confirmed conventional power" detail aligns with the ship being described as a scaled-up DDG(X) (which uses an Integrated Power System but is not nuclear-powered like a CVN) and the absence of "N" (Nuclear) in the ship's hull classification (BBG vs BBGN).

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>The post is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the U.S. Constitution, there is no legal requirement to swear an oath of office on a Bible or any other religious text. The claim that you "can swear on whatever... book you want," including <em>Harry Potter</em>, is legally and practically accurate.</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constitutional Basis:</strong> <strong>Article VI, Clause 3</strong> of the U.S. Constitution explicitly states that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States." This prohibits the government from mandating the use of a specific religious book.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Precedent:</strong> Officials are required to take an oath to support the Constitution, but the <em>object</em> they place their hand on (if any) is purely ceremonial.</li>
<li><strong>Real-World Examples:</strong> To prove the point that "whatever book" is acceptable, elected officials have sworn in on a wide variety of texts:<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. Seuss:</strong> In 2019, Kelli Dunaway was sworn into the St. Louis County Council on a copy of <em>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</em></li>
<li><strong>Superman Comic:</strong> In 2023, U.S. Representative Robert Garcia was sworn in on a first-edition <em>Superman</em> comic book (along with a photo of his parents and his citizenship certificate).</li>
<li><strong>The Constitution:</strong> Many officials, including President John Quincy Adams and Senator Kyrsten Sinema, have sworn on a book of law or a copy of the Constitution itself.</li>
<li><strong>Kindle:</strong> Ambassador Suzi LeVine was sworn in using a Kindle e-reader showing the 19th Amendment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>"Harry Potter":</strong> While there are no widely publicized reports of a high-ranking U.S. official using <em>Harry Potter</em> specifically, doing so would be entirely legal based on the precedents above.</li>
