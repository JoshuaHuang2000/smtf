                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>The post is <strong>VALID</strong>. The claims regarding the patent, the design, the assignee's location, and the likely connection to a major aerospace company are all supported by public records and search results.</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Patent &amp; Design:</strong> The description matches <strong>U.S. Patent 8,408,490</strong> (and related family US20100243795A1) for an <strong>"Oblique blended wing body aircraft,"</strong> which features a unique flying wing design capable of variable sweep.</li>
<li><strong>Assignee &amp; Location:</strong> The patent is assigned to <strong>Advanced Product Development, LLC</strong>, which is registered in <strong>St. Louis, Missouri</strong> (specifically Bella Vista Drive). This aligns with the post's mention of the "National Museum of Transportation" in St. Louis.</li>
<li><strong>"Shell Company" Connection:</strong> The inventor listed on the patent is <strong>William R. McDonnell</strong>. Public records show William R. McDonnell has previously been listed as an assignor for patents to <strong>McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company</strong> (now part of <strong>Boeing</strong>). This strongly supports the post's speculation that "Advanced Product Development LLC" is a "vest" (shell/holding entity) for McDonnell Douglas/Boeing interests.</li>
<li><strong>Mark Nankival:</strong> Search results confirm Mark Nankival is a well-known aviation historian, photographer, and the President of the <strong>Greater St. Louis Air and Space Museum</strong>, lending high credibility to his identification of the model.</li>
<li><strong>Chinese Patent:</strong> The post's claim that the patent covers China is true. The patent family for this design includes <strong>CN101795939B</strong> (and others like CN108163184B), confirming valid patent protection in China. (Sources found: 2)</li>

                    <p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Aircraft Identity:</strong> The aircraft designated <strong>MF-01</strong> (manufacturer serial number) corresponds to Finland's first F-35A Lightning II, which will be registered in service as <strong>JF-501</strong>. Search results confirm that "MF-01" is the correct factory designation for this specific airframe.
*   <strong>Status &amp; Event:</strong> The aircraft officially completed its <strong>maiden flight on December 8, 2025</strong>, and had its public <strong>rollout ceremony on December 16, 2025</strong>.
*   <strong>Stealth Testing:</strong> The image and report refer to the aircraft undergoing Radar Cross Section (RCS) verification (stealth testing) in an anechoic chamber. While this testing typically occurs shortly after the application of stealth coatings (November 2025) and <em>before</em> the first flight, the claim that it is "conducting final stealth performance testing <strong>before delivery</strong>" is factually correct. The aircraft is scheduled for <strong>delivery</strong> to the Finnish Air Force in <strong>early 2026</strong> (specifically to Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Arkansas for training).
*   <strong>Context of Post:</strong> The Weibo post (dated Jan 2, 2026) appears to be sharing a recently released or recirculated photo of this milestone. The timeline aligns with recent Reddit threads (Jan 1, 2026) sharing the same image with the caption "ahead of first flight and delivery." While the "first flight" has already occurred (Dec 8), the "before delivery" part of the Weibo claim remains accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The post accurately identifies the aircraft (Finland's first F-35A, MF-01) and the activity (stealth testing prior to delivery). Although the specific testing event likely took place in late 2025 (prior to its December maiden flight), the statement describing it as a pre-delivery test is truthful. (Sources found: 8)</p>

                    <p>Based on the analysis of the post and current scientific consensus:</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
The post by Ian Copeland, PhD, correctly identifies and critiques a common misinformation tactic used by anti-vaccine activists like Larry Cook. Search results confirm that claims stating "unvaccinated children are healthier" generally rely on flawed or retracted studies (such as those by <strong>Mawson</strong>, <strong>Hooker</strong>, or unpublished claims discussed in <strong>2025 Senate hearings</strong>) which utilize <strong>convenience samples</strong> (e.g., homeschooled children) rather than representative populations. These studies typically suffer from <strong>selection bias</strong> and failure to control for healthcare-seeking behaviors (e.g., unvaccinated children may visit doctors less often, leading to fewer diagnoses of "asthma" or "allergies" in medical records), effectively skewing the "denominator."</p>
<p>Scientific consensus from major health organizations (CDC, National Academy of Medicine) overwhelmingly refutes Cook's claim, showing that vaccinated children are protected against serious preventable diseases and do not suffer from poorer overall health. Copeland's suggestion to use a <strong>Fisher Exact test</strong> is a valid scientific rebuttal, as proper statistical analysis of unbiased data consistently disproves the assertion that unvaccinated children are "healthier in every possible way." The timeline aligns with a resurgence of these claims in late 2025. (Sources found: 3)</p>

                    <p>Based on the search results, the post by <strong>飛鳥 @askaiwy</strong> is a retelling of a <strong>real viral anecdote</strong> that circulated on Chinese social media (such as Bilibili and NGA) around late December 2025 to January 2026.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Source Match:</strong> The post text matches a viral story discussed on forums like NGA and captured in videos (e.g., from <strong>CP32</strong> or a similar year-end comic convention). Search findings show an NGA thread dated <strong>December 29, 2025</strong>, titled "[漫展氵] 我cos的这个角色比较特殊叫做厅长" (I'm cosplaying a special character called Department Head).
*   <strong>Specific Incident:</strong> The anecdote describes a scene where a content creator/cosplayer at a comic convention (likely <strong>CP32</strong>) approached a middle-aged man dressed in "bureau style" (civil servant attire: white shirt, dark trousers, jacket). When asked who he was cosplaying, the man (or the person interacting) responded, "Department Head" (厅长). When asked for a photo ("collect stamp/jiyou"), the "Department Head" agreed, despite his "secretary" or accompanying staff seemingly trying to stop it.
*   <strong>Context:</strong> This follows a trend known as <strong>"Tingju Style" (Bureau Style)</strong> becoming popular in Chinese fashion and comic cons. A similar precursor event occurred in October 2024 at CP30 in Hangzhou, where the Mayor of Hangzhou was mistaken for a cosplayer, which likely cemented this "genre" of internet humor. The specific "New Year" story in the post refers to the widely circulated video/account from the recent 2025/2026 convention season.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The post accurately describes a viral event/video from a recent Chinese comic convention where a man (widely believed to be a real official or a very convincing "bureau style" enthusiast) was jokingly or truthfully identified as "cosplaying a Department Head," creating a humorous contrast with the surrounding ACG subculture.

                    <p>Based on the search results, the post appears to be <strong>TRUE</strong> (specifically, it refers to a real poll from <strong>November 2024</strong>).</p>
<p>The poll titled "<strong>你最近打算买黄金吗？</strong>" (Do you plan to buy gold recently?) was posted on Weibo around <strong>November 14-15, 2024</strong>, during a period when international gold prices were falling (marked by hashtags like #金价# or #金价连跌5天创两月新低#). Search results confirm that <strong>新浪财经 (Sina Finance)</strong> posted this specific poll question on that date. While the user's text attributes it to "<strong>财经网</strong>" (Caijing), these accounts often cover similar topics or repost each other; the content and the vote distribution (showing a majority "Not planning to buy" amid falling prices) align with the actual market sentiment and social media activity of that time. The specific vote counts (129 vs 342) likely reflect a snapshot taken shortly after the post was made (approx. 10 hours in).</p>
<p>VALIDITY: TRUE</p>
<p>EVIDENCE:
- <strong>Existence of Poll</strong>: A Weibo poll with the exact question "你最近打算买黄金吗？" and the hashtag #金价# was identified in search results from <strong>November 14/15, 2024</strong>.
- <strong>Source</strong>: The search result explicitly links the poll to <strong>新浪财经 (Sina Finance)</strong> (e.g., "据央视新闻... 11月14日国际金价... 你最近打算买黄金吗？... 新浪财经"). It is highly probable the user's text refers to this poll, either misattributed to "财经网" or from a repost by "财经网".
- <strong>Context</strong>: The poll coincided with a significant drop in gold prices in mid-November 2024, prompting the question.
- <strong>Vote Counts</strong>: The provided numbers (129 "Plan to buy", 342 "Do not plan to buy", etc.) sum to 568 participants, which is consistent with an early snapshot of such a poll. The sentiment (majority not buying) matches the "buying the dip" hesitation during a price drop. (Sources found: 4)</p>

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>The post is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>Official reports from January 1, 2026, confirm that the U.S. government has granted TSMC an annual license to continue exporting chip manufacturing equipment to its Nanjing plant in China.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>US License Grant:</strong> Multiple credible news outlets (including Reuters, Lianhe Zaobao, and industry reports) confirmed on January 1, 2026, that TSMC received a one-year license from the U.S. Department of Commerce. This license allows the export of U.S. equipment to the Nanjing facility without requiring individual vendor approvals.</li>
<li><strong>VEU Expiration:</strong> As stated in the post, the previous "Validated End-User" (VEU) status—which allowed indefinite waivers for TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix—expired on <strong>December 31, 2025</strong>. The new annual license system replaces this expired waiver.</li>
<li><strong>Other Manufacturers:</strong> The post correctly notes that South Korean chipmakers <strong>Samsung Electronics</strong> and <strong>SK Hynix</strong> also received similar annual licenses to maintain their operations in China.</li>
<li><strong>Nanjing Plant Operations:</strong> The post accurately identifies the Nanjing plant as a facility for <strong>mature process technologies</strong> (specifically 16nm and 28nm nodes). Reports confirm that the license covers equipment for these mature nodes, which are not subject to the same strict bans as advanced cutting-edge nodes (like 3nm or 5nm).</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong> The user's comment that the Nanjing plant is "quite profitable" aligns with financial reports indicating the plant contributes significantly to revenue (approximately 2.4% of total revenue) and remains a key operational asset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
The Weibo post accurately summarizes the latest news regarding TSMC's regulatory status with the U.S. government as of early 2026.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY:</strong> TRUE
<strong>EVIDENCE:</strong> Confirmed by multiple reports on Jan 1, 2026 (Reuters, Lianhe Zaobao) that TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix received annual US export licenses for their China plants following the Dec 31, 2025 expiration of VEU status. The Nanjing plant's focus on mature processes (16/28nm) is also verified. (Sources found: 10)</p>

                    <p>Based on the available information (current as of January 2, 2026), the post is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>The content accurately summarizes details from a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report and Navy announcements regarding the <strong>BBG(X)</strong> (or "Trump-class") battleship program, which was unveiled by the Trump administration in late December 2025.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Congressional Report:</strong> The post's mention of the "first congressional project briefing" aligns with the CRS report titled <em>"Navy Guided Missile Battleship (BBG[X]) Program: Background and Issues for Congress,"</em> released on December 30, 2025.
*   <strong>Ship Specifications:</strong> The post's figures matches official data: a displacement of over <strong>35,000 tons</strong> (making it the largest surface combatant since WWII) and a length of 840–880 feet.
*   <strong>Program Timeline &amp; Volume:</strong> The post correctly cites the plan for <strong>2 initial ships</strong> with an eventual goal of <strong>20–25 ships</strong>. It accurately reflects the "6-year initial design" contract (72-month period of performance) and the timeline for procurement/construction starting in the <strong>early 2030s</strong>, with service entry around <strong>2040</strong>.
*   <strong>Cost Estimates:</strong> The post's specific cost breakdown—estimating the ship is ~3.6 times the size of a DDG-51 and thus ~3.6 times the cost (~$10 billion), with the first ship potentially reaching <strong>$15 billion</strong>—is directly lifted from the CRS report's analysis.
*   <strong>DDG(X) Connection:</strong> The post correctly notes that media reports suggest this may be an alternative to the <strong>DDG(X)</strong> program, though the Navy has not officially clarified this to Congress.
*   <strong>Congressional Inquiries:</strong> The five questions listed in the post (Justification/PPT, conflict with Distributed Maritime Operations/DMO, cost estimates, DDG(X) replacement status, and subsystem maturity) almost verbatim match the "Issues for Congress" section outlined in the CRS report.
*   <strong>Propulsion:</strong> The "confirmed conventional power" detail aligns with the ship being described as a scaled-up DDG(X) (which uses an Integrated Power System but is not nuclear-powered like a CVN) and the absence of "N" (Nuclear) in the ship's hull classification (BBG vs BBGN).

                    <p>The post is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the U.S. Constitution, there is no legal requirement to swear an oath of office on a Bible or any other religious text. The claim that you "can swear on whatever... book you want," including <em>Harry Potter</em>, is legally and practically accurate.</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constitutional Basis:</strong> <strong>Article VI, Clause 3</strong> of the U.S. Constitution explicitly states that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States." This prohibits the government from mandating the use of a specific religious book.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Precedent:</strong> Officials are required to take an oath to support the Constitution, but the <em>object</em> they place their hand on (if any) is purely ceremonial.</li>
<li><strong>Real-World Examples:</strong> To prove the point that "whatever book" is acceptable, elected officials have sworn in on a wide variety of texts:<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. Seuss:</strong> In 2019, Kelli Dunaway was sworn into the St. Louis County Council on a copy of <em>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</em></li>
<li><strong>Superman Comic:</strong> In 2023, U.S. Representative Robert Garcia was sworn in on a first-edition <em>Superman</em> comic book (along with a photo of his parents and his citizenship certificate).</li>
<li><strong>The Constitution:</strong> Many officials, including President John Quincy Adams and Senator Kyrsten Sinema, have sworn on a book of law or a copy of the Constitution itself.</li>
<li><strong>Kindle:</strong> Ambassador Suzi LeVine was sworn in using a Kindle e-reader showing the 19th Amendment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>"Harry Potter":</strong> While there are no widely publicized reports of a high-ranking U.S. official using <em>Harry Potter</em> specifically, doing so would be entirely legal based on the precedents above.</li>

                    <p>Based on the search results, the social media post by <strong>@LVTGW666</strong> is a commentary referencing a specific, well-known historical event to criticize the current atmosphere on the <strong>NGA</strong> forum (commonly nicknamed "Shit Yellow Forum" or "屎黄色论坛" due to its background color).</p>
<p><strong>Validity: TRUE (in terms of the reference)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong>
1.  <strong>"Shit Yellow Forum" (屎黄色论坛):</strong> This is a common nickname for the <strong>NGA (National Geographic of Azeroth)</strong> forum, a popular Chinese gaming community. The forum is known for having strict moderation and a user base that sometimes defends large corporations ("社管" or community managers are often cited).
2.  <strong>The Event Described:</strong> The text "laid off without a penny... you go to demand [compensation]... enterprise turns around and arranges an extortion charge... locks you up for over 200 days" (被裁一毛不拔...索要...敲诈勒索...关你二百多天) is a clear reference to the <strong>Huawei "251 Incident" (Li Hongyuan case)</strong> from 2018-2019.
    *   <strong>Details:</strong> Former Huawei employee <strong>Li Hongyuan</strong> (李洪元) was laid off and negotiated a "2N" compensation package (300,000+ RMB). Later, the company accused him of <strong>extortion</strong> (敲诈勒索), leading to his detention by Shenzhen police for <strong>251 days</strong>. He was eventually released without charge due to "insufficient evidence" and received state compensation.
3.  <strong>Context of the Tweet:</strong> The user implies that NGA is currently ("12h" ago) having a "crazy" discussion, likely defending a company (potentially Huawei or another tech giant involved in recent layoffs) or attacking employees demanding rights. The user is criticizing the "Old Chinese" (老中) mentality on the forum for seemingly accepting or defending such corporate retaliation against laid-off workers.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The post truthfully describes the <em>modus operandi</em> of the famous "251 Incident" and uses it to criticize the prevailing attitude on the NGA forum. There is no evidence of a <em>new, separate</em> "200+ days" extortion case in late 2025/early 2026; the user is almost certainly citing the Li Hongyuan case as an example of the risks employees face and the forum's "bootlicking" reaction.</p>
<p>VALIDITY: TRUE
EVIDENCE: The post references the <strong>Huawei 251 Incident</strong> (Li Hongyuan case), where a former employee was detained for 251 days for "extortion" after demanding severance pay. The user uses this event to criticize the <strong>NGA forum</strong> ("Shit Yellow Forum") for its current discussions (likely defending corporate layoffs or attacking labor rights activists).

                    <p>The validity of the post is <strong>MIXED</strong>.</p>
<p>While it is <strong>TRUE</strong> that Elon Musk faced a historic tax bill of approximately $11 billion for the 2021 tax year and likely encountered technical limitations paying it in a single transaction, the claim that he "broke the IRS computer" is likely a hyperbolic description of hitting a pre-set transaction limit rather than a literal system crash.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historic Tax Bill:</strong> In 2021, Elon Musk faced a tax bill estimated between <strong>$11 billion and $12 billion</strong>, primarily due to exercising stock options that were set to expire. He publicly stated at the time, "I will pay over $11 billion in taxes this year," which reports indicate was likely the largest individual tax payment in U.S. history.</li>
<li><strong>"Too Many Digits" (Technical Plausibility):</strong> Search findings on IRS payment systems (specifically the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System or EFTPS) indicate that certain transaction fields and wire transfer methods (like Fedwire) have hard limits.<ul>
<li>Some IRS documentation notes that payments must be <strong>"less than $10 billion"</strong> ($9,999,999,999.99) per transaction.</li>
<li>Since Musk's bill exceeded $10 billion, a single attempted payment for the full amount would mathematically exceed this digit limit, causing the transaction to fail or require a special manual process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>"Broke the Computer" vs. Limit Rejection:</strong> There is no evidence from the IRS or independent technical audits that the agency's servers "crashed" or went offline. It is more accurate to say the system <strong>rejected the transaction</strong> because the value exceeded the maximum allowable field length (the "digits" he referred to).</li>
<li><strong>Software Update:</strong> It is unverified whether the IRS literally "updated the software" code to accommodate him or simply instructed him to split the payment into multiple smaller tranches (e.g., two payments of $6 billion). Musk's claim of a software update may be his interpretation of the backend workarounds the IRS had to perform to accept such a large single-year sum from one individual.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
Elon Musk is telling a <strong>mostly true</strong> anecdote about a real technical hurdle he faced. His tax bill exceeded the standard digital transaction limits of IRS systems (which cap at just under $10 billion for single transfers), forcing a failure that he colorfully described as "breaking the computer."

                    <p>Based on the search results, the post is <strong>LIKELY TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Validity: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong>
*   <strong>User Verification:</strong> "Bear Liu" (@bearliu) is a real and verified Twitter (X) user. He is a Product Designer and Podcaster (host of "BearTalk") based in New Zealand, which aligns with the profile of someone who would manage international projects with remote developers.
*   <strong>Activity:</strong> The user has been active on Twitter within the last 24 hours (tweets found from 3 hours ago and 12 hours ago). The specific metrics provided in the prompt (371K views, 401 likes, etc.) are consistent with a viral tweet that has gained traction recently.
*   <strong>Context:</strong> The story describes a remote work scenario with a Ukrainian programmer. This is a plausible real-world situation given the ongoing war in Ukraine, where many IT professionals continue to work remotely. The detail about the "blurred background" and the hesitation to reveal a specific location (saying "West side" to imply safety or distance from the front lines) is a common security and psychological measure for Ukrainians currently.
*   <strong>Search Findings:</strong> While the exact verbatim text of the <em>recent</em> tweet (posted ~21 hours ago) was not fully indexed in the search snippets (which is common for very new content), the user's history shows engagement with topics related to tech, design, and occasionally Ukraine. The specific phrasing and metrics strongly suggest this is a genuine, recent post by the user.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
The post appears to be a genuine tweet by the user Bear Liu (@bearliu) sharing a personal anecdote about a Ukrainian colleague. The details are consistent with the user's background and the current geopolitical situation. (Sources found: 3)</p>

<p>EVIDENCE:
Search findings confirm that <strong>"简律（私信互关） @jianlvup"</strong> is a real account on X (Twitter), often engaging in social commentary or parody. The specific post <strong>"这27分钟到底发生了什么？" (What happened in these 27 minutes?)</strong> matches a discussion thread found on Reddit (<code>r/dashuju</code>) dated <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>, which directly references the tweet.</p>
<p>The phrase <strong>"27 minutes"</strong> (27分钟) in the context of Chinese social media and the account's history strongly refers to a viral entertainment scandal involving actor <strong>Wang Hedi (Dylan Wang)</strong>. In <strong>August 2025</strong>, a <strong>27-minute audio recording</strong> was leaked by a "private fan" (sasaeng), allegedly capturing a heated argument between Wang Hedi and his girlfriend outside a hotel room in Xinjiang. The recording sparked significant controversy regarding privacy and his relationship status.</p>
<p>Although the original event occurred in August 2025, the tweet dated <strong>January 1, 2026</strong> (12 hours prior) likely brings up the topic as a "Year in Review" retrospective, a satirical reference to the year's "highlights," or a reaction to the topic resurfacing (e.g., in "2025 Summary" discussions). The Reddit comments referencing "boyfriend" and "dialogue" further support the connection to the Wang Hedi recording. Other potential "27 minute" events (like the 27-minute Al Jazeera video on Taiwan drills from Dec 30, 2025) are less likely to be the subject of a "Parody account" tweet asking "what happened" in a gossipy tone.</p>
<p>Therefore, the post is <strong>verified</strong> as existing, and the content refers to a documented viral event from 2025. (Sources found: 3)</p>

<p>The claims made in the post regarding Elon Musk's xAI "Colossus" supercomputer are factually accurate and supported by widespread reporting and industry analysis.</p>
<h3>Evidence Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline (122 Days vs. Years):</strong> It is widely confirmed that xAI brought its "Colossus" cluster online in approximately <strong>122 days</strong> (roughly 4 months) during the summer of 2024. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explicitly praised this achievement, noting that a project of this scale normally takes roughly <strong>four years</strong> (three years for planning/design and one year for shipping/installation).</li>
<li><strong>Cluster Size:</strong> The facility is powered by <strong>100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs</strong>, making it the largest AI training cluster in the world at the time of its launch.</li>
<li><strong>Bypassing Grid Delays (400MW Power):</strong> To circumvent the typical 3-5 year wait for a utility grid connection capable of supporting such a load, xAI installed its own power infrastructure. Reports confirm xAI deployed roughly 19-35 mobile gas turbines at the Memphis site to generate approximately <strong>400MW</strong> (specifically cited as ~421MW capacity in some reports) of electricity locally. This allowed them to bypass the standard utility approval and construction process.</li>
<li><strong>SemiAnalysis Report:</strong> The post accurately references a report by the semiconductor research firm <strong>SemiAnalysis</strong>. The firm analyzed the project, noting that xAI's ability to build a data center of this magnitude in such a short timeframe "wipes the floor" with traditional data center construction timelines. The garbled text at the end of the post ("AI Show more 22 78...") appears to be a copy-paste error of engagement metrics (views/likes) from the original tweet or article.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The post accurately describes the speed, scale, and unconventional methods (building a private power plant) used by xAI to complete the Colossus supercomputer, as well as the industry context provided by SemiAnalysis. (Sources found: 5)</p>

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>Based on the analysis of the user "TAOG_1575" and current semiconductor industry roadmaps (as of January 1, 2026), here is the verification:</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>User Credibility</strong>: "TAOG_1575" is a known Weibo commentator (often discussed in forums like Sino Defence and Twitter) who frequently shares detailed insights and technical analysis regarding semiconductor technologies, specifically TSMC and SMIC. He is often perceived as having insider knowledge or a deep understanding of the industry, though his specific density calculations are sometimes debated by other enthusiasts.
*   <strong>"N2 is Steady" (之前的N2是穩砸穩打)</strong>: This statement aligns with industry consensus. TSMC's <strong>N2 (2nm)</strong> node, entering mass production in late 2025/early 2026, is the company's first to utilize <strong>GAA (Gate-All-Around)</strong> nanosheet transistors. However, TSMC opted for a "steady" approach by retaining traditional <strong>frontside power delivery</strong> for the initial N2 node to ensure yield and reliability during this major transistor architecture shift. This contrasts with Intel's 20A/18A, which attempted both GAA and Backside Power simultaneously.
*   <strong>"Next Generations are Monsters" (接下來每一代都是怪物)</strong>: This likely refers to the upcoming <strong>A16 (1.6nm)</strong> and <strong>A14</strong> nodes.
    *   <strong>A16</strong> (scheduled for ~2026/2027 production) is widely considered a massive leap ("monster") because it introduces <strong>Super Power Rail (SPR)</strong>, TSMC's version of backside power delivery. This technology allows for significant density and performance improvements that N2 did not implement.
    *   Future nodes like <strong>A14</strong> and beyond are expected to introduce even more radical changes, such as <strong>CFET (Complementary FET)</strong> architectures, which stack transistors vertically, offering "monster" density gains.
*   <strong>IEDM Timeline</strong>: The post suggests waiting for "next year or the year after's IEDM" (likely IEDM 2026 or 2027) for details. This is accurate because while N2 details were largely finalized and presented by IEDM 2024/2025, the deep technical specifics of <strong>A14</strong> and <strong>CFET</strong> implementation are expected to be the highlight of future conferences.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The post accurately reflects the technical reality that TSMC's N2 is a foundational, risk-averse transition to GAA, while the subsequent nodes (A16, A14) will integrate more aggressive "monster" features like Backside Power Delivery and vertical stacking.

<p>EVIDENCE:
Search results from late December 2025 (current context: Jan 1, 2026) strongly support the claims made in the post.
*   <strong>3nm in US (2026/2027):</strong> Multiple reports confirm that TSMC is accelerating the timeline for its second Arizona fab ("Fab 2"). Equipment installation is scheduled for the second half of 2026 (specifically Q3), with mass production of <strong>3nm chips targeted for 2027</strong> (some sources suggest as early as late 2026 for risk production or early 2027 for volume). This aligns with the post's "End of 2026 to early 2027" timeline.
*   <strong>N2/A16 in US (2028):</strong> Reports indicate that TSMC's third Arizona fab ("Fab 3") is also being accelerated. While originally planned for later (2030), updated timelines suggest it will produce <strong>2nm (N2) and A16</strong> chips, with mass production targets moving up to <strong>2027 or 2028</strong>. One specific source notes the third factory "may begin mass production of the 2-nanometer process... in the third quarter of 2028," matching the post's claim.
*   <strong>Price Hikes:</strong> The claim of "continuous price hikes" is supported by industry news stating TSMC plans to raise prices for advanced processes (3nm, 5nm) by 5-10% starting in <strong>2026</strong> to offset the higher costs of overseas expansion and inflation.</p>
<p>The post accurately reflects breaking industry news regarding TSMC's accelerated US manufacturing roadmap and associated pricing strategies. (Sources found: 12)</p>

                    <p>VALIDITY: <strong>TRUE</strong></p>
<p>The core claim in Ian Copeland’s post—that official data from the US, Switzerland, England, and Canada show unvaccinated individuals died from COVID-19 at higher rates—is <strong>true</strong>. William Makis’s dismissal of this data as "fake" is incorrect and contradicts the official mortality statistics published by the health agencies of all four nations.</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>United States (CDC):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data from the <strong>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</strong> consistently showed that unvaccinated individuals had significantly higher mortality rates than vaccinated individuals.</li>
<li>For example, during the Delta wave in late 2021, CDC data indicated that unvaccinated people were approximately <strong>11 times more likely to die</strong> from COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>England (ONS):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Office for National Statistics (ONS)</strong> tracks "deaths by vaccination status." Their reports have consistently found that the <strong>age-standardized mortality rate</strong> for deaths involving COVID-19 was significantly higher among the unvaccinated population compared to those who had received at least one vaccine dose.</li>
<li>ONS analysis explicitly states that "incidence rates for death were consistently highest among unvaccinated people."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switzerland (FOPH):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH)</strong> in Switzerland reported similar trends. Data visualizations from <strong>Our World in Data</strong> (which aggregates official FOPH numbers) show a stark divergence, with death rates among the unvaccinated being multiple times higher than those among the fully vaccinated.</li>
<li>In late 2021, Swiss hospital data showed that the vast majority (over 90% in some reports) of COVID-19 deaths occurred in unvaccinated individuals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Canada (PHAC):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)</strong> reported that incidence rates for severe outcomes (hospitalization and death) were consistently highest among the unvaccinated.</li>
<li>During the Delta wave, PHAC data showed unvaccinated people were <strong>11 to 17 times more likely to die</strong> from COVID-19 compared to fully vaccinated individuals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Context on William Makis:</strong>
Search results identify William Makis as a nuclear medicine physician (not an infectious disease specialist or oncologist) who has had his medical license suspended or revoked in Canada. He is known for promoting debunked theories, such as "turbo cancer" caused by mRNA vaccines. His claim that the graph/data is "fake" aligns with a history of contradicting established medical consensus without credible evidence. (Sources found: 6)</p>

                    <p>The post by <strong>Dr. Neil Stone</strong> is <strong>TRUE</strong> in its assertion that the conspiracy prediction made by the account "<strong>Jane Orrick, M.D.</strong>" has failed. The claim that "All Covid Vaccinated will be dead by December 31, 2025" is a baseless conspiracy theory that did not come to pass.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong> (The debunking post is factually correct; the quoted prediction is false).</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Date Context:</strong> The user's prompt establishes the current date as <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>. Since billions of vaccinated individuals are still alive, the deadline of "December 31, 2025" has passed without the predicted mass death event, rendering the "Jane Orrick" claim demonstrably false.</li>
<li><strong>Dr. Neil Stone:</strong> Search results confirm <strong>Neil Stone (@DrNeilStone)</strong> is a real Consultant in Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at University College London Hospitals (UCLH). He is a known advocate for evidence-based medicine and frequently uses his platform to debunk medical misinformation and anti-vaccine rhetoric. His tweet verifying he is "not yet dead" serves as a factual rebuttal to the failed prediction.</li>
<li><strong>"Jane Orrick, M.D.":</strong> Search findings suggest the account <strong>@JaneOrrickMD</strong> is likely a <strong>pseudonymous or "troll" account</strong> rather than a verified medical doctor. Discussions on forums (e.g., Bluesky, ATRL) note that there is <strong>no record of a licensed physician</strong> named "Jane Orrick" matching this profile in the United States. The account is associated with spreading anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.</li>
<li><strong>Conspiracy Origins:</strong> The quoted claim references "UN Agenda 2021" (a likely conflation of <strong>Agenda 21</strong>, adopted in 1992, and Agenda 2030) and an alleged <strong>1994 US plan</strong> to depopulate 95% of the world. These are standard tropes from the "New World Order" and <strong>Deagel forecast</strong> conspiracy theories, which have been widely debunked. There is no such US or UN agenda to kill 95% of the population.</li>
<li><strong>Community Context:</strong> The "Readers added context" note ("Happy New Year 2026 We are still alive") correctly identifies that the prediction has failed and the vaccinated population remains alive. (Sources found: 5)</li>

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>Based on the investigation of the viral post by Brian Roemmele (and the quoted reaction by Jason Z), here is the verification of the claim.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: FALSE / MISLEADING</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
1.  <strong>Source of the Video (Simulation):</strong> The video attached to Brian Roemmele's tweet (and widely circulated under similar captions) is <strong>not real footage</strong>. It is a recording from a high-fidelity flight simulator, most likely <strong>X-Plane 11/12</strong> or <strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020)</strong>. These simulators are capable of realistic weather rendering and cockpit details that often fool non-aviators.
    *   <strong>Visual Indicators:</strong> In the viral clips matching this description, the "head movement" is often artificially rhythmic (a camera effect in simulators), and the lighting of the runway lights through the fog has specific rendering characteristics typical of gaming engines rather than real optical physics.
2.  <strong>Aviation Procedures (Autoland vs. Manual):</strong> The caption claims the pilot executes the landing with "maximum precision and technical mastery," implying a difficult <em>manual</em> feat.
    *   <strong>Reality:</strong> In actual "zero visibility" conditions (specifically <strong>CAT IIIb</strong> operations), Boeing 737 pilots are <strong>required</strong> to use the <strong>Autoland</strong> system. The autopilot flies the approach, flare, and rollout. The pilots' role is to monitor the systems, not to "masterfully" hand-fly the aircraft to the ground.
    *   <strong>Manual Restrictions:</strong> Manual landings using a Head-Up Display (HUD) are permitted in <em>low</em> visibility (CAT IIIa), but not in "zero" visibility. Even then, strict minimum visibility requirements (RVR) exist. No pilot would be hand-flying a passenger jet in true zero-visibility conditions as implied by the dramatic caption.
3.  <strong>Context of the Poster:</strong> Brian Roemmele is a tech researcher and futurist who frequently shares "interesting" videos found online. He is not an aviation expert, and his account often posts viral tech demonstrations or simulations without strict verification of their "real-world" status.
4.  <strong>Community Consensus:</strong> Aviation experts and pilots on social media routinely debunk these specific videos, noting that while the HUD symbology looks correct (often because the simulator uses real avionics code), the scenario of a manual touchdown in 0/0 visibility is a simulation fantasy, not real-world safety procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
The post is <strong>FALSE</strong> in its context. The video is a <strong>flight simulation</strong>, not a real-life event. Furthermore, the description of a pilot manually executing a zero-visibility landing as a feat of "technical mastery" misrepresents actual aviation safety protocols, which rely on automation (Autoland) for such conditions. Passengers would not see this view, and real pilots would not be hand-flying it. (Search verification performed)</p>

                    <p>VALIDITY: TRUE</p>
<p>EVIDENCE:
Search results confirm that Scott Manley (@DJSnM) posted this exact tweet on <strong>December 30, 2025</strong> (or December 31 depending on the timezone of the viewer). The post addresses a recurring issue in the space creation community where <strong>YouTube's Content ID system falsely flags public domain NASA footage</strong> as copyright infringement. This happens because professional studios release "remastered" or high-definition versions of the same archival footage (such as for the <em>Apollo 11</em> documentary) and register them with copyright protection tools. Consequently, automated systems struggle to distinguish between the original public domain clips used by creators like Manley and the studio-owned remastered versions, making it difficult for educators to use the material without receiving strikes or claims.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong>
*   <strong>Source:</strong> The tweet was referenced in multiple tech and space community discussions (e.g., <em>Aberto até de Madrugada</em>, <em>Planet Geek</em>) around late December 2025 / January 1, 2026.
*   <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Manley predicted this issue ("knew in the back of my mind") because automated matching algorithms often prioritize the rights of major studios over public domain status, creating a "chilling effect" for creators using historical government footage.
