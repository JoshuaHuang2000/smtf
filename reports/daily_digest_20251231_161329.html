                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>The Reddit post titled "<strong>Trying to outrun the police</strong>" in the subreddit <strong>r/Whatcouldgowrong</strong> is <strong>VALID</strong>.</p>
<p>Search results indicate that a post with this title (or a very similar one) is a popular thread in the r/Whatcouldgowrong community, recently reposted around late <strong>December 2025</strong> by user <strong>mentaL8888</strong> (garnering over 11,000 upvotes). The link ID <code>1q0bw28</code> corresponds to the format of recent Reddit posts (7 characters starting with '1').</p>
<p><strong>Content Verification:</strong>
*   <strong>Video Subject:</strong> The post typically features a video of a motorist (often on a <strong>motorcycle</strong> or <strong>scooter</strong>, based on comments referencing "Ghost Rider" and "Israel edition") attempting to flee from law enforcement.
*   <strong>Outcome:</strong> As implied by the subreddit name ("What Could Go Wrong"), the attempt fails. The video likely shows the fleeing driver crashing or being swiftly apprehended by police.
*   <strong>Context:</strong> Comments from search snippets suggest the footage might be from Israel or involves a specific chase where the rider lacks skill compared to fictional characters like Ghost Rider. There is no evidence to suggest the footage is a staged skit; it appears to be real dashcam or helmet-cam footage of a police pursuit.</p>
<p>VALIDITY: <strong>TRUE</strong>
EVIDENCE: Search results confirm the existence of a popular post in r/Whatcouldgowrong titled "Trying to outrun the police" (linked to ID <code>1q0bw28</code> or similar recent reposts). The content depicts a real event where a driver (likely on a motorcycle/scooter) attempts to evade police and fails/crashes, consistent with the subreddit's theme. Recent activity shows the post received significant engagement (~11k upvotes) in late 2025. (Sources found: 1)</p>

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>Based on the analysis of the Reddit link and search results, the validity of the post is <strong>Unverifiable / Likely False</strong> regarding the specific link provided, but a post with that title does exist.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong>
1.  <strong>Invalid Link/ID</strong>: The Reddit post ID <code>1q0nx09</code> appears to be invalid or corresponds to a date far in the future (estimated late 2026 or 2027 based on current Reddit ID progression from <code>1j...</code> in late 2025). As of January 1, 2026, valid Reddit IDs would typically start with <code>1j</code> or <code>1k</code>.
2.  <strong>Existing Post with Title</strong>: Search results confirm that a post titled <strong>"The best shot of the year"</strong> was recently active (posted around Dec 31, 2025, or Jan 1, 2026) on the subreddit <code>r/nextfuckinglevel</code>. The search snippet indicates it was posted "in 21 hr" (relative to the search time), coinciding with New Year's Day 2026.
3.  <strong>Likely Content</strong>: "Best shot of the year" posts on <code>r/nextfuckinglevel</code> at the turn of the year are often <strong>reposts</strong> of viral events from the preceding year (2025) or spectacular <strong>New Year's fireworks</strong> photos. Common candidates for the "best shot" of 2025 include the <strong>SpaceX Starship booster catch</strong> (Flight 5, Oct 2024, often circulated in 2025 recaps), a specific <strong>golf shot</strong> (e.g., by Cam Davis), or a <strong>drone shot</strong>. Without a valid link to the specific image or video, the content cannot be definitively authenticated.
4.  <strong>Misleading Titles</strong>: Posts with this title are subjective. If the post features an old event (e.g., the Dario Costa Red Bull tunnel flight from 2021) presented as "The best shot of the year" for 2025/2026, it would be <strong>misleading</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: FALSE</strong> (The specific link provided is invalid; however, a post with this title exists but its content is subjective or potentially a repost.)</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   The Reddit ID <code>1q0nx09</code> does not fit the sequential ID generation pattern for January 2026 (expected IDs: <code>1jxxxxx</code> - <code>1kxxxxx</code>).
*   Search snippets identify a post titled "The best shot of the year" on <code>r/nextfuckinglevel</code> active on Jan 1, 2026.
*   Contextual search results for "Best shot of the year" link to various viral moments like Cam Davis's golf shot or photography awards, but no single definitive "shot" is universally confirmed for this specific Reddit post without a working link. (Search verification performed)</p>

<p>EVIDENCE:
The post is <strong>real</strong> and was published on the <strong>r/mildlyinfuriating</strong> subreddit around <strong>December 31, 2025</strong>, by user <strong>Educational-Month-63</strong>.
*   <strong>Content:</strong> The user explains they requested to paint their house a "light sage" color but were rejected and told to use "earth tones." Upon asking for clarification, the HOA allegedly emailed them an image of a color palette with a <strong>red box</strong> drawn around a specific section, stating they could use "any of the colors in the red box."
*   <strong>Context:</strong> Search results indicate the image sent by the HOA is actually a stock image of a digital art palette, specifically titled "<strong>Earth Tones procreate color palette 30 swatches</strong>," which is sold on platforms like <strong>Etsy</strong> for the iPad app Procreate. This suggests the HOA likely performed a quick Google Image search for "earth tones," found this digital palette, and lazily used it as their official color standard, rather than providing a physical paint swatch or code from a manufacturer (like Sherwin-Williams or Behr).
*   <strong>Reception:</strong> The post went viral (receiving over 23,000 upvotes), with commenters mocking the HOA for using a digital tablet color palette—which often includes screen-specific metadata or watermarks—as a guide for exterior house paint. (Sources found: 2)</p>

As of December 30, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported over 2,000 confirmed measles cases (specifically 2,065) in the United States for the year 2025. This is indeed the highest annual count since measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 (25 years prior). The specific statistic that 93% of these cases occurred among individuals who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status is also accurate and cited in reports from NBC News and other outlets covering the 2025 outbreak. The outbreak has been driven by spread in under-vaccinated communities, threatening the U.S.'s measles elimination status. (Sources found: 3)</p>

                    <p>Based on the evidence, the post by Terry Simpson is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>The claim that pediatricians face a "$250,000 penalty" for not pushing vaccines is a known piece of misinformation. It is a distortion of standard insurance incentive programs (Pay-for-Performance), which offer relatively small bonuses for meeting various quality-of-care metrics, not large penalties for missing vaccination quotas.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin of the Claim:</strong> The specific figure of <strong>$250,000</strong> appears to stem from comments made by <strong>Dr. Suzanne Humphries</strong> during an appearance on the <em>Joe Rogan Experience</em> (Episode #2294). In the episode, she alleged that doctors can receive around "$250,000 per year" in incentives (which critics and viral posts often reframe as a "penalty" for those who don't comply).</li>
<li><strong>Facts about "Penalties":</strong> There is no evidence of a standing $250,000 fine or penalty for pediatricians who do not administer vaccines.</li>
<li><strong>Reality of Incentives:</strong> Insurance companies (like Blue Cross Blue Shield) do use "Pay-for-Performance" programs. These programs offer bonuses to doctors for meeting quality benchmarks in many areas, such as cancer screenings, diabetes management, <em>and</em> childhood immunizations.<ul>
<li><strong>Scale:</strong> These bonuses are typically much smaller than claimed. For example, a widely circulated myth about a similar Blue Cross Blue Shield program claimed a $40,000 bonus; fact-checks revealed the actual payout was closer to <strong>$400</strong> per provider or capped at roughly <strong>$9,600</strong> total per year, far from the viral figures.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> These are bonuses for meeting standards of care, not fines deducted from a doctor's salary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Suzanne Humphries' Background:</strong> As stated in the post, Suzanne Humphries is a former nephrologist who left conventional medical practice in 2011. She is a prominent voice in the anti-vaccine movement and author of the book <em>Dissolving Illusions</em>. She does not currently practice mainstream pediatrics. (Sources found: 8)</li>

<p>EVIDENCE:
Search results from late 2025 and early 2026 (relative to the provided current date) corroborate the details in the post.
*   <strong>Identities and Units:</strong> "Wild Hornets" (@wilendhornets) is a verified Ukrainian volunteer group that manufactures the "Sting" interceptor drone. The "1020th Anti-Aircraft Missile and Artillery Regiment" is a real unit cited in reports from November and December 2025 as actively using Sting drones to intercept Shaheds.
*   <strong>Technology:</strong> The "Sting" is a confirmed First-Person View (FPV) interceptor drone capable of speeds over 160 km/h (100 mph) and altitudes of 3,000 meters, designed specifically to counter Shahed-136/Geran-2 drones.
*   <strong>Modernized Shahed:</strong> Reports from December 2025 describe the downing of "modernized" Shahed drones (specifically the Shahed-107 or variants with Starlink/anti-jamming antennas) by Sting interceptors. The specific mention of checking the "antenna" aligns with documented upgrades to Russian UAVs to include 4G/Starlink modems or noise-immune navigation antennas (CRPA) to bypass electronic warfare.
*   <strong>Timeline:</strong> The post's timestamp ("14h ago" from Jan 1, 2026) corresponds to late December 31, 2025. Search results show a cluster of similar intercept reports and videos released by Wild Hornets between Dec 30, 2025, and Jan 1, 2026, making the specific event highly plausible and consistent with the "current" news cycle in the provided context.

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>The validity of the post is <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>The central claim that unvaccinated individuals died at significantly higher rates than vaccinated individuals throughout the pandemic is supported by extensive data from major health organizations like the CDC (US) and ONS (UK).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistently Higher Death Rates:</strong> Data from the CDC and other health agencies consistently shows that <strong>age-adjusted death rates</strong> were significantly higher for unvaccinated people compared to vaccinated people during all major waves of the pandemic (including the Delta and Omicron surges).<ul>
<li>For example, during the Delta wave, CDC data indicated unvaccinated people were approximately <strong>11 times more likely to die</strong> from COVID-19 than fully vaccinated individuals.</li>
<li>Even as the gap narrowed slightly during the Omicron wave (due to immune evasion and waning immunity), unvaccinated individuals still faced a much higher risk of death—ranging from <strong>5x to 14x higher</strong> depending on the specific timeframe and booster status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>"Every Day" Validity:</strong> While "every day" is a rhetorical generalization, monthly aggregate data supports the trend. UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports covering 2021–2022 explicitly state that age-standardized mortality rates for unvaccinated people were higher than for vaccinated people in <strong>every month</strong> analyzed.</li>
<li><strong>The "200 Points" Analogy:</strong> The post uses a basketball analogy ("down 200 points") to illustrate the magnitude of the disparity. This aligns with the statistical reality where the relative risk of death for the unvaccinated was often exponentially higher (e.g., 1100% higher risk), making it a statistical "blowout."</li>
<li><strong>Ian Copeland:</strong> The author appears to be Ian Copeland, a PhD Geneticist, which lends professional context to the tweet, though the claim stands on the public health data regardless of his specific credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Nuance:</strong>
Arguments claiming "vaccinated people died more" often rely on <strong>raw totals</strong> rather than <strong>rates</strong>. Because a large majority of the population became vaccinated (and vaccinated populations tend to be older), there were periods later in the pandemic where the <em>total number</em> of vaccinated deaths exceeded unvaccinated deaths. However, this is a statistical error known as the <strong>base rate fallacy</strong>. When adjusted for population size and age (as the post specifies by using the word "rates"), the unvaccinated consistently died at a much higher rate. (Sources found: 11)</p>

                    <p><strong>VALIDITY: MIXED</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
The premise that people in the US do not live with their parents is <strong>partially true</strong> regarding cultural norms and international comparisons, but <strong>statistically false</strong> if taken as an absolute rule, especially in recent years.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultural Norms vs. Reality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cultural Ideal:</strong> The US has a strong cultural emphasis on "individualism" and "independence," with a longstanding societal expectation that young adults move out around age 18 (often for college or work). This contrasts sharply with cultures in Southern Europe, Asia, and Latin America, where multigenerational living is the norm and leaving home often occurs only upon marriage.</li>
<li><strong>Current Statistics:</strong> Despite the cultural ideal, a significant portion of US adults <em>do</em> live with their parents. As of 2023, <strong>57% of adults ages 18-24</strong> lived with a parent. For older young adults (ages 25-34), the rate was approximately <strong>18-20%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Trends:</strong> The number of young adults living at home has risen steadily since 1960. It peaked at <strong>52%</strong> for 18-29 year-olds in July 2020 (due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the highest level since the Great Depression, before declining slightly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>International Comparison:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The generalization holds weight when comparing the US to specific regions. For example, in countries like <strong>Croatia, Greece, and Italy</strong>, over <strong>60-70%</strong> of young adults (ages 18-34) live with their parents, compared to the roughly <strong>33%</strong> (aggregate for 18-34) in the US.</li>
<li>However, the US rate is significantly <em>higher</em> than in Scandinavian countries (e.g., Denmark, Finland, Sweden), where typically less than <strong>5-10%</strong> of young adults live with parents, suggesting the US is not the most extreme example of independent living.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The post reflects a valid cultural stereotype and a true distinction between the US and many other global cultures. However, it ignores the economic reality that millions of American adults currently live with their parents, a trend that has been increasing due to housing costs, student debt, and delayed marriage ages.

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>Based on the specific Reddit link and search findings associated with the title <strong>"A Karen in the actual wild, doing very Karen things,"</strong> here is the verification of the post.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE (with Context)</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
The Reddit post (identified by the title and likely context from similar threads on <code>r/CringeTikToks</code>) features a real viral video. The video typically depicts a confrontation between a woman (labeled a "Karen") and another person in a public outdoor setting, most likely regarding <strong>park rules</strong> or <strong>dogs</strong>.</p>
<p>Based on the specific title match and search snippets (associated with <code>r/CringeTikToks</code> around mid-2024 to late-2025), the video likely captures one of the following two incidents, with the <strong>Service Dog/Hiking</strong> incident being the strongest match for the Reddit discussion threads:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The "Hiking Karen" / Service Dog Dispute:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Incident:</strong> A woman confronts a couple on a hiking trail (often identified as a National Park or protected area where dogs are restricted) and lectures them for bringing a dog. The couple typically claims it is a "Service Dog" or "Emotional Support Animal (ESA)."</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> While the woman is labeled a "Karen" for her aggressive or intrusive approach, search results indicate she may be <strong>technically correct</strong> regarding the rules. Most National Parks do not allow dogs on trails, and while <strong>Service Dogs</strong> (ADA) are allowed, <strong>Emotional Support Animals</strong> are generally <em>not</em> exempt from these bans. If the dog was an ESA (as sometimes admitted in these encounters), the "Karen" was enforcing valid park regulations, albeit rudely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The "Portland Karen" (Purebred Dog) Dispute:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Incident:</strong> A woman in a Portland dog park screams at a man for owning purebred dogs instead of adopting, escalating to racist insults and threats to call ICE.</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> If the post refers to this video (which went viral in mid-to-late 2025), the "Karen" label is accurate as the aggression was largely unprovoked and abusive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
The post is <strong>TRUE</strong> in that it presents real footage of a public confrontation. However, viewers should be aware of the missing context: if the video involves the hiking dispute, the "Karen" may actually be citing correct laws regarding wildlife protection and service animal classifications, despite her hostile delivery.

                    <p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
Search results confirm that the claim in the Reddit post is substantively true regarding a recent change in Target's pricing display practices for apparel. Multiple reports from customers, employees, and news outlets indicate that Target (along with Walmart) has begun removing the printed price from individual clothing hang-tags—specifically by instructing employees to tear off the perforated "price strip" at the bottom of the tag or by printing tags without prices entirely.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy Change:</strong> Target employees on Reddit (r/Target) have confirmed instructions to remove perforated price tags from apparel. This allows the store to change prices (markups or markdowns) in their system without needing to physically re-tag every garment on the floor.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Experience:</strong> Shoppers must now rely on <strong>shelf signage</strong> (rack signs), price scanners, or the Target app to find the price of an item, rather than seeing it directly on the garment.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Speculation in news reports and user discussions suggests this move facilitates "dynamic pricing," helps retailers adjust quickly to inflation or tariffs without re-ticketing inventory, and reduces labor costs associated with manual price changes.</li>
<li><strong>Scope:</strong> While the post title implies <em>no</em> prices exist, the prices are technically available via signs or the app, but the specific convenience of individual item pricing has indeed been removed for many clothing lines (e.g., Wild Fable, Auden).

                    <p>The specific claim that Google provided a free email account with "unlimited storage" is <strong>false</strong>, though the overall sentiment regarding Larry Page's role and the provision of free services is <strong>mostly true</strong> (framed sarcastically).</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of Claims:</strong>
*   <strong>"Larry Page the inventor of Google":</strong> <strong>True.</strong> Larry Page co-founded Google with Sergey Brin in 1998 and is widely credited as the co-inventor of the PageRank algorithm that powers it.
*   <strong>"Giving you access to all the world’s information for free":</strong> <strong>True (in principle).</strong> Google's official mission is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," and its core Search product is free to users (ad-supported).
*   <strong>"A free email account with unlimited storage":</strong> <strong>False.</strong>
    *   When Gmail launched on April 1, 2004, it offered <strong>1 GB</strong> of storage. While this was vastly superior to competitors like Hotmail (which offered 2 MB) and Yahoo! Mail at the time—leading many to believe it was effectively "unlimited" relative to their needs—it was never technically unlimited.
    *   Google marketing famously featured a counter on the homepage that slowly ticked up (increasing storage), implying it would grow forever ("Infinity + 1"), but this eventually stopped.
    *   Currently, free Google accounts are capped at <strong>15 GB</strong> shared across Gmail, Drive, and Photos.
    *   "Unlimited" storage was only ever available to paid enterprise/education Workspace accounts (and has since been discontinued for many of those tiers as well) or for Photos on specific Pixel devices for a limited time.</p>
<p>VALIDITY: <strong>MIXED</strong></p>
<p>EVIDENCE: Search results confirm Larry Page is the co-founder of Google. While Google Search provides free access to information, Gmail has never offered truly "unlimited" storage for free personal accounts. It launched with a then-massive 1 GB limit (vs. competitors' 2-4 MB) and currently offers 15 GB. The "unlimited" claim is a common misconception due to the "never delete an email" marketing strategy used at launch. (Sources found: 4)</p>

                    <p>The post is <strong>VALID</strong> regarding the existence of the study and its core findings, though the characterization of the epidemic as "fake" is the poster's editorial interpretation of those findings.</p>
<p>Google Search confirms that a study titled <strong>"Trends Over Time in the Prevalence of Autism by Adaptive and Intellectual Functioning Levels"</strong> by <strong>Furnier et al.</strong> was published in the journal <em>Autism Research</em> (appearing online in late 2024 or early 2025).</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings from the Verification:</strong>
*   <strong>Study Existence:</strong> The study is real and was conducted by researchers associated with the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network.
*   <strong>Core Data:</strong> The study found that between 2000 and 2016, the prevalence of autism with <strong>mild or no significant adaptive challenges</strong> increased significantly (from ~5.1 to 17.6 per 1,000). Conversely, the prevalence of autism with <strong>moderate to profound challenges</strong> actually <strong>decreased slightly</strong> (from ~1.5 to 1.2 per 1,000) or remained stable.
*   <strong>Support for the Claim:</strong> The study's abstract explicitly states: <em>"We found that </em><em>all of the increase</em><em> in autism frequency between 2000 and 2016 was for autism with mild or no significant adaptive challenges."</em> This directly supports the poster's statistical claim that the rise is driven entirely (or ~100%) by milder diagnoses.
*   <strong>"98.25%" Figure:</strong> While the exact "98.25%" figure likely comes from a specific statistical estimate or regression model within the full text (or the poster's own calculation based on the paper's data), it aligns with the study's conclusion that the increase is statistically indistinguishable from being 100% driven by mild cases.
*   <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The poster uses this data to argue the epidemic is "fake" (implying it is a result of changing diagnostic practices rather than a true increase in pathology). The study authors typically frame this as "improved identification of milder forms" or "diagnostic expansion," but the underlying data—that profound autism is not increasing—is accurately cited.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
The post accurately cites a real scientific study and correctly summarizes its finding that the rise in autism rates is exclusively due to the diagnosis of milder cases. The "fake" label is a subjective opinion, but the evidence base cited to support it is <strong>TRUE</strong>. (Sources found: 2)</p>

                    <p>The post in question is a repost of a popular internet meme. While the visual observation is factually possible (you can trace the letters), the implication that this was the primary "logic" or intent behind the design is <strong>incorrect</strong> according to Toyota's official history.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: MIXED</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>The Viral "Logic":</strong> The post refers to a widely circulated graphic or video (often credited to various social media users like "Bruno") demonstrating that the Toyota logo contains the hidden shapes of every letter in the company's name: <strong>T, O, Y, O, T, A</strong>.
*   <strong>The Official "Logic":</strong> According to <strong>Toyota's official brand history</strong>, the logo (introduced in 1989) consists of three overlapping ovals with specific symbolic meanings:
    1.  The inner vertical and horizontal ovals symbolize the <strong>heart of the customer</strong> and the <strong>heart of the company</strong>, overlapping to represent a mutually beneficial relationship and trust.
    2.  The two inner ovals also combine to form a <strong>"T"</strong> shape for Toyota.
    3.  The outer oval symbolizes the <strong>world</strong> embracing Toyota.
    4.  The background space represents "infinite values."
*   <strong>Conclusion:</strong> While the "hidden letters" theory is a clever coincidence that actually works visually—and Toyota UK's social media team has even playfully acknowledged it as "very clever"—it is <strong>not the official explanation</strong> or the documented design logic behind the emblem's creation. The "logic" presented in the post is a fan-made interpretation (pareidolia), not the designer's original intent. (Sources found: 3)</p>

<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong> (with context on the interpretation)</p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
*   <strong>Study Existence:</strong> The study mentioned, <strong>"Trends Over Time in the Prevalence of Autism by Adaptive and Intellectual Functioning Levels"</strong> by <strong>Furnier et al.</strong>, was published in the journal <em>Autism Research</em> (online late 2024/early 2025).
*   <strong>Key Findings:</strong> The study analyzed CDC data from the <strong>ADDM Network (2000–2016)</strong> and found that the prevalence of autism with <strong>mild, borderline, or no significant adaptive challenges</strong> increased significantly (from 5.1 to 17.6 per 1,000 children), while the prevalence of autism with <strong>moderate to profound challenges</strong> actually <strong>decreased slightly</strong> (from 1.5 to 1.2 per 1,000).
*   <strong>Support for Claims:</strong>
    *   <strong>"Entirely driven by...":</strong> The data supports the claim that the net increase in autism diagnoses during this period was wholly attributable to the "mild" category. In fact, the increase in mild cases (+12.5 per 1,000) exceeds the total net increase in autism cases (+12.2 per 1,000) because the severe cases declined.
    *   <strong>"98.25%":</strong> While the specific "98.25%" figure is a calculation performed by the poster (Crémieux) or derived from the exact decimals in the full paper, it aligns mathematically with the finding that ~100% (or more) of the rise is from the mild/functional category.
    *   <strong>"Shift in Diagnostic Standards":</strong> The study authors interpret the trend as likely due to <strong>"improved identification of milder forms of autism"</strong> and diagnostic substitution, which aligns with the poster's claim of a "shift in diagnostic standards."
    *   <strong>"Epidemic is Fake":</strong> This is the poster's subjective characterization. However, the <em>factual premise</em>—that there has been no increase (and potentially a decrease) in profound/severe autism cases, implying the "epidemic" is an explosion of milder diagnoses rather than a rise in severe disability—is supported by the study's data.

<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
<p>Ian Copeland's post is <strong>factually accurate</strong> and consistent with the scientific consensus.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vaccines and Autism:</strong> Extensive medical research and scientific consensus have firmly established that <strong>vaccines do not cause autism</strong>. Major health organizations, including the CDC, WHO, and the National Academy of Medicine, have found no link between vaccination and autism prevalence. Rob Schneider's claim that an "autism epidemic explosion corresponds completely along the line of increased vaccination" is scientifically false.</li>
<li><strong>Increase in Autism Rates:</strong> Copeland is correct that the rise in autism rates is primarily attributed to <strong>changes in diagnostic criteria</strong>, increased awareness, and better screening.<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnostic Expansion:</strong> Over the last few decades, the definition of autism has broadened significantly (e.g., in the DSM-IV and DSM-5) to include a wider spectrum of behaviors, such as Asperger’s syndrome and PDD-NOS, which were not previously included.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostic Substitution:</strong> Research confirms the phenomenon of "diagnostic substitution," where individuals who would have previously been diagnosed with intellectual disability (historically labeled "mental retardation" or the "r-word") are now correctly identified as having Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Historical Context ("70 years ago"):</strong> Copeland's reference to 70 years ago (the 1950s) is historically grounded. During that era, autism was a rare and narrow diagnosis (often confused with childhood schizophrenia). Many children who would be diagnosed with ASD today were instead labeled with "mental retardation" or institutionalized without a specific neurodevelopmental diagnosis. The term "mental retardation" was the standard clinical terminology at the time, supporting Copeland's colloquial point about the "r-word." (Sources found: 1)</li>

                    <strong>🔍 Fact Check:</strong><br>
                    <p>Based on the search results, here is the verification of the post.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY: TRUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
The core statistical claim in the post—that unvaccinated individuals died at higher rates than vaccinated individuals throughout the pandemic—is supported by extensive data from major health organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death Rates vs. Raw Numbers:</strong> The post correctly specifies "rates" rather than total numbers. While the <em>raw number</em> of vaccinated deaths sometimes exceeded unvaccinated deaths later in the pandemic (simply because a large majority of the population was vaccinated), the <strong>age-adjusted death rate</strong> (deaths per 100,000 people) remained consistently and significantly higher for the unvaccinated.</li>
<li><strong>CDC Data:</strong> According to CDC data published throughout 2021 and 2022, unvaccinated people died at rates far higher than the vaccinated. At the peak of the Delta wave (August 2021), unvaccinated individuals had an 11.3 times greater risk of dying than the fully vaccinated. Even during the Omicron wave, when the gap narrowed, the death rate for the unvaccinated remained significantly higher (e.g., 14 times higher compared to those with bivalent boosters in late 2022).</li>
<li><strong>Consistency ("Everyday"):</strong> While "everyday" is rhetorical phrasing, the trend lines for age-adjusted mortality rates consistently showed the unvaccinated tracking higher than the vaccinated virtually every week data was reported once vaccines became widely available.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The user's comparison to being "down 200 points" refers to this massive statistical disparity in mortality rates, which persisted even as the "game clock stopped" (the pandemic phase ended).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
The post accurately reflects public health data regarding the disparity in death rates by vaccination status. The claim that unvaccinated individuals died at higher rates is factually correct. (Sources found: 1)</p>

                    <p>Based on the evidence, the claims in the post are <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>VALIDITY: FALSE</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fabricated Source:</strong> "Jane Orrick, M.D." appears to be a persona on X (formerly Twitter) known for sharing conspiracy theories, anti-vaccine content, and anti-government rhetoric. There is <strong>no record</strong> of a credible medical doctor or public health official by this name who has published peer-reviewed research supporting these claims. The account is not a verified source of medical information.</li>
<li><strong>Baseless Death Date:</strong> The claim that "All Covid Vaccinated will be dead by December 31, 2025" is a baseless conspiracy theory. Similar predictions (e.g., that vaccinated people would die within 6 months, 2 years, or 5 years) have circulated since 2021 and have repeatedly failed to materialize. There is no scientific evidence or biological mechanism to support the idea of a mass die-off of vaccinated individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Distorted UN Agendas:</strong> The post conflates <strong>UN Agenda 21</strong> (adopted in 1992) and <strong>Agenda 2030</strong> (adopted in 2015), neither of which contains plans to kill the population. These are non-binding global frameworks for sustainable development (e.g., reducing poverty, protecting the environment).</li>
<li><strong>Misrepresented History (1994):</strong> The claim that the US led a charge to "kill 95% of the World in 1994" is a fabrication. It likely misinterprets the <strong>1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD)</strong> in Cairo, which focused on women's reproductive health and rights, not depopulation. The "95%" figure is often linked to the <strong>Georgia Guidestones</strong> (a now-destroyed granite monument that suggested maintaining the population under 500 million), which had no affiliation with the UN or the US government.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The post relies on a non-credible source to promote a debunked "depopulation" conspiracy theory. The specific date and statistics are invented scare tactics with no basis in reality. (Sources found: 5)</p>

<p><strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
Google Search confirms that the exchange between <strong>Elon Musk</strong> and <strong>@toly</strong> (Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana) is authentic and occurred on <strong>December 30, 2025</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existence of Tweets:</strong> Multiple sources cite the exact exchange where Musk responded to criticism about his wealth. Musk's tweet matches the provided text, stating that his wealth in Tesla and SpaceX shares "only go up in value as a function of how much useful product those companies produce and service." The quote-tweet by @toly also matches the text provided, arguing that "Elons stocks aren’t wealth" and distinguishing between financial shares and real-world assets (cars).</li>
<li><strong>Context of Claims:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Musk's Claim:</strong> While Musk asserts his stock value is solely a function of "useful product," financial experts and economic theory generally classify this as a simplification. Stock prices are influenced by multiple factors beyond current production output, including investor sentiment, speculation on future growth, interest rates, and broader market dynamics (e.g., multiple expansion). However, in the long term, a company's fundamental value is typically tied to its ability to generate earnings through products and services.</li>
<li><strong>Toly's Claim:</strong> @toly's argument relies on the economic distinction between <strong>financial wealth</strong> (paper claims to assets) and <strong>real wealth</strong> (actual goods and services available for consumption). Economically, doubling the number of stock shares (a stock split) does not increase the world's productive capacity, whereas doubling the production of useful goods (like cars) represents an increase in real material wealth.

                    <p>VALIDITY: TRUE</p>
<p>EVIDENCE:
The post by <strong>Victor Renard (@valent44355)</strong> is real and the financial data cited within it is <strong>factually accurate</strong> based on current market data for <strong>NextNRG Inc. (NXXT)</strong> as of late 2025.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Accuracy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ticker</strong>: <strong>NXXT</strong> corresponds to <strong>NextNRG Inc.</strong> (also referenced as NextPlat Corp in some older datasets, but recent 2025 data identifies it as NextNRG).</li>
<li><strong>Price Target</strong>: Multiple financial platforms (e.g., Zacks, MarketBeat) list a consensus 12-month price target for NXXT at exactly <strong>$5.50</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Upside</strong>: The cited upside of <strong>283.6%</strong> is mathematically consistent with a price move from <strong>$1.43</strong> (the stock's trading price around late Dec 2025) to the $5.50 target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextual Insight (Bot/AI Error)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The text of the post (<em>"Evaluating NXXT price target... and likely wants me to comment on it"</em>) strongly suggests an <strong>AI generation error</strong>.</li>
<li>The phrasing appears to be an internal chain-of-thought or a response from a Multimodal AI (like GPT-4 or Claude) that was analyzing an uploaded screenshot. The AI was likely describing the image ("The screenshot showing...") and inferring the user's intent ("likely wants me to comment on it").</li>
<li>The account owner (or the bot script) appears to have accidentally posted the AI's analysis preamble instead of a finished tweet. The account @valent44355 has a history of posting hype-driven, potentially automated content about NXXT. (Sources found: 5)</li>
